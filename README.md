# KiCad Learning Project: [MCU Datalogger]

This repository documents my progress through the **"KiCad Like a Pro"** curriculum by **Peter Dalmaris**. 

The goal of this project is to practice professional PCB design workflows, moving from a theoretical schematic to a physical, manufacturable board.
